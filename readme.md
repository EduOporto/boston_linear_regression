# Boston Housing Dataset (guided practice)

Using the Boston's Housing Dataset available in Sklearn library, which contains information about different houses in Boston, I performed a full basic and explained data analysis and linear regression process on a Jupyter Notebook.

    - Check the data for nulls
    - Explore the data, distributions, correlations.
    - Take that into mind when choosing the features for your model.
    - Watch out for colinearity.
    - Split your data into train and test. Check out how!
    - Measure the goodness of your fit! R2, RMSE, etc.
    - Try to make it better.
    - Do your own research. Checkout both sklearn and statsmodels, get a feel of both.
